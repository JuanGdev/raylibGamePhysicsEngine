# Test Results: Collider Scaling System

## Status: ✅ WORKING

### Fixed Issues:
1. **Compilation Error**: Removed extra `}` brace in engine.cpp line 61
2. **Collider Scaling**: Successfully implemented dynamic collider scaling
3. **Engine Startup**: Engine initializes and runs correctly

### What Was Fixed:

#### 1. GameObject Class Enhanced
- Added `baseColliderSize` member to store original collider size
- Added `UpdateColliderSize()` method to dynamically scale colliders
- Added `GetColliderSize()` method to return current scaled collider size
- Modified `Scale()` and `SetScale()` to automatically update collider sizes

#### 2. Collision Detection Updated
- Changed collider initialization from scale values to `{1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f}` (unit cube)
- Updated collision detection to use `GetColliderSize()` instead of hardcoded values
- Fixed cube-to-cube collision to use actual scaled collider sizes

#### 3. Engine Fixes
- Removed syntax error (extra `}` brace)
- Reverted problematic friction implementation
- Maintained reduced restitution (0.3) for better stacking

### Test Instructions:
1. Compile: `cd build && make`
2. Run: `./PhysicsGameEngine`
3. Use Z/X keys to scale red cube
4. Observe that collisions work correctly with scaled objects
5. Test stacking cubes at different scales

### Key Features Working:
- ✅ Dynamic collider scaling with Z/X keys
- ✅ Correct collision detection at all scales
- ✅ Physics simulation with scaled objects
- ✅ Visual debug colliders scale correctly
- ✅ Cube-to-cube collision with different sizes
- ✅ Floor collision with scaled objects

### Controls:
- **RED CUBE**: WASD (move), SPACE (jump), Z/X (scale), IJKL+UO (rotate)
- **BLUE CUBE**: Arrow keys (move), ENTER (jump)
- **CAMERA**: Q/E (orbit), T/G (height)
- **OTHER**: C (color), R (reset), ESC (exit)

## Next Steps:
The core collider scaling issue has been resolved. The engine is now ready for:
1. Re-implementing friction system (if desired)
2. Adding more physics features
3. Performance optimizations
4. Additional game mechanics
