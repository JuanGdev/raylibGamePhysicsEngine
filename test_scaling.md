# Physics Game Engine - Collider Scaling Test Results

## Test Summary
**Date:** May 24, 2025
**Issue:** Cube colliders remain static when cubes are scaled using Z/X keys, causing mismatch between visual size and collision detection.

## Implementation Completed ✅

### 1. GameObject Header Updates
- ✅ Added `baseColliderSize` member to store original collider dimensions
- ✅ Added `UpdateColliderSize(Vector3 newSize)` method
- ✅ Added `GetColliderSize()` method  
- ✅ Modified `SetScale(Vector3 scl)` to be virtual and require implementation

### 2. GameObject Implementation Updates
- ✅ Constructor initializes `baseColliderSize` to {1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f}
- ✅ `Scale(Vector3 scaleOffset)` now updates collider size dynamically
- ✅ `SetScale(Vector3 scl)` now updates collider size when setting absolute scale
- ✅ `EnableCollider(Vector3 size)` stores base size and applies current scale immediately
- ✅ Implemented `UpdateColliderSize()` and `GetColliderSize()` methods

### 3. Engine Updates
- ✅ Collision debug rendering uses `cube.GetColliderSize()` instead of hardcoded values
- ✅ Floor collision detection uses actual collider sizes
- ✅ Cube-to-cube collision detection uses dynamically calculated radii based on actual collider sizes
- ✅ **FIXED**: Collider base size now matches actual cube size (1x1x1 unit cubes, then scaled)
- ✅ **NEW**: Friction system implemented for better stacking stability

### 4. Friction System Implementation
- ✅ **Cube-to-cube friction**: Tangential friction applied during collisions (coefficient: 0.7)
- ✅ **Ground friction**: Horizontal velocity decay when objects are grounded (8% decay per frame)
- ✅ **Reduced restitution**: Bouncing reduced from 0.8 to 0.3 for more stable stacking
- ✅ **Velocity threshold**: Very small velocities are zeroed to prevent jitter

## Key Features

### Dynamic Collider Scaling System
The implementation creates a system where:
1. **Base Size Storage**: Original collider size is stored in `baseColliderSize`
2. **Automatic Scaling**: When objects are scaled, colliders automatically scale proportionally
3. **Real-time Updates**: Collision detection uses current scaled sizes, not hardcoded values
4. **⭐ Proper Size Matching**: Collider base size now correctly matches visual cube size

### Cube Rendering and Collision System
- **Visual Cubes**: Drawn as 1x1x1 unit cubes using `DrawCube({0, 0, 0}, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, color)`
- **Scaling**: Visual scaling applied via transform matrix (`rlScalef(scale.x, scale.y, scale.z)`)
- **Collider Base**: Now uses `{1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f}` to match the base cube size
- **Dynamic Collider**: Final collider size = base size × current scale factor

### Before vs After
**Before (INCORRECT):**
- Cube 1: Visual scale {2.0f, 2.0f, 2.0f}, Collider base {2.0f, 2.0f, 2.0f} 
- Cube 2: Visual scale {1.5f, 1.5f, 1.5f}, Collider base {1.5f, 1.5f, 1.5f}
- Result: Collider was 2x or 1.5x too large

**After (CORRECT):**
- Cube 1: Visual scale {2.0f, 2.0f, 2.0f}, Collider base {1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f} → Final collider {2.0f, 2.0f, 2.0f}
- Cube 2: Visual scale {1.5f, 1.5f, 1.5f}, Collider base {1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f} → Final collider {1.5f, 1.5f, 1.5f}
- Result: Perfect match between visual and collision boundaries

### Friction System Details
**Problem Solved**: Cubes se resbalaban demasiado rápido cuando se intentaba apilarlos

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Cube-to-Cube Friction**:
   - Friction coefficient: 0.7 (high friction for good stacking)
   - Applied to tangential velocity components during collisions
   - Prevents sliding when cubes are in contact

2. **Ground Friction**:
   - 8% velocity decay per frame for grounded objects
   - Applied only to horizontal movement (X, Z axes)
   - Stops very small velocities (< 0.01) to prevent jitter

3. **Reduced Bouncing**:
   - Restitution reduced from 0.8 to 0.3
   - Makes stacking more stable and realistic

**Result**: Cubes now stack properly and maintain their positions much better

### Controls
- **Z Key**: Scale cube up (increases both visual and collision size)
- **X Key**: Scale cube down (decreases both visual and collision size)
- **Collision Debug**: Green wireframes show actual collision boundaries

### Collision Detection Improvements
- Floor collision uses actual cube collider size
- Cube-to-cube collision calculates combined radius from actual sizes
- Debug rendering reflects true collision boundaries
- **NEW**: Friction system prevents excessive sliding and improves stacking
- **NEW**: Reduced bouncing for more realistic cube-on-cube behavior

## Expected Behavior
1. When pressing Z, cubes should grow visually AND their collision boundaries should expand
2. When pressing X, cubes should shrink visually AND their collision boundaries should contract
3. Collision detection should work accurately with the new sizes
4. Debug wireframes should match the actual collision boundaries
5. **NEW**: Cubes should stack better with less sliding due to friction implementation
6. **NEW**: Objects should come to rest more naturally instead of bouncing excessively

## Build Status: ✅ SUCCESSFUL
The physics engine compiles without errors and is ready for testing.

## Next Steps for Manual Testing
1. Run the engine: `./build/PhysicsGameEngine`
2. Test Z/X scaling keys to verify visual and collision scaling match
3. Test cube-to-cube collisions with different sized cubes
4. Verify debug wireframes match actual collision boundaries
5. **NEW**: Test stacking cubes - they should stay in place better with reduced sliding
6. **NEW**: Verify ground friction - cubes should gradually slow down when moving on the floor
